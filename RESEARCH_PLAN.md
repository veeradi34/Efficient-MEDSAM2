# Research Experiment Plan for EfficientMedSAM2 Paper

## 1. Comprehensive Evaluation Metrics
- Dice Similarity Coefficient
- Intersection over Union (IoU)
- Hausdorff Distance (95th percentile)
- Average Surface Distance
- Clinical metrics (sensitivity, specificity)

## 2. Baseline Comparisons
- Direct training of small model (no distillation)
- Traditional knowledge distillation
- Pruning-based compression
- Quantization methods
- Other medical segmentation models (U-Net, DeepLab)

## 3. Multi-Dataset Validation
- MSD Task01 (Brain Tumors) âœ“ Current
- MSD Task03 (Liver) - Add this
- MSD Task05 (Prostate) - Add this  
- Custom hospital dataset (if available)

## 4. Ablation Studies
- Stage-by-stage distillation contribution
- Memory attention vs standard attention
- Channel adaptation impact
- Different backbone architectures (MobileNet vs EfficientNet)

## 5. Deployment Analysis
- Inference time on CPU vs GPU
- Memory consumption analysis
- Mobile device performance (Android/iOS)
- Edge device deployment (Jetson Nano, etc.)

## 6. Clinical Validation
- Radiologist evaluation of segmentation quality
- Inter-rater agreement analysis
- Clinical workflow integration study
- Error analysis on challenging cases

## 7. Statistical Analysis
- Cross-validation (5-fold)
- Statistical significance testing (t-tests, Wilcoxon)
- Confidence intervals for metrics
- Power analysis for sample size justification
