\begin{abstract}
Medical image segmentation models like MedSAM2 achieve state-of-the-art performance but require substantial computational resources (600M+ parameters), limiting their deployment in resource-constrained environments such as mobile devices, edge computing, and low-resource healthcare settings. We present EfficientMedSAM2, a lightweight medical image segmentation model derived through a novel three-stage knowledge distillation framework. Our approach progressively transfers knowledge from MedSAM2 teacher to a compact student architecture, achieving 100× parameter reduction (5.5M parameters) while maintaining competitive segmentation performance. The framework incorporates medical-specific adaptations including 4-channel MRI handling, ROI-aware memory attention, and progressive distillation stages: feature-level distillation, memory-aware distillation, and end-to-end fine-tuning. Evaluated on the Medical Segmentation Decathlon Task01 brain tumor dataset (484 samples), EfficientMedSAM2 demonstrates significant computational efficiency gains while preserving clinical-grade accuracy. Our complete framework and trained models are made publicly available to facilitate medical AI deployment in resource-limited scenarios.

\section{Introduction}

Medical image segmentation has witnessed remarkable advances with the emergence of foundation models like SAM \cite{kirillov2023segment} and its medical variants MedSAM \cite{ma2024medsam} and MedSAM2 \cite{cheng2024medsam2}. These models demonstrate exceptional performance across diverse medical imaging tasks, achieving state-of-the-art results in organ segmentation, lesion detection, and anatomical structure delineation. However, their deployment in real-world clinical settings faces significant computational barriers.

Modern medical segmentation models, particularly MedSAM2 with over 600 million parameters, require substantial computational resources that are often unavailable in practical healthcare environments. This limitation is particularly acute in:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Point-of-care diagnostics}: Mobile and portable imaging devices with limited processing power
    \item \textbf{Resource-constrained healthcare}: Hospitals and clinics in developing regions with limited computational infrastructure  
    \item \textbf{Real-time applications}: Surgical guidance systems requiring immediate feedback
    \item \textbf{Edge deployment}: Integration with Internet-of-Things (IoT) medical devices
\end{itemize}

Knowledge distillation \cite{hinton2015distilling} has emerged as a promising solution for model compression, enabling the transfer of knowledge from large teacher models to compact student networks. However, existing distillation approaches are primarily designed for natural image domains and fail to address the unique challenges of medical imaging, including multi-channel data (e.g., 4-channel MRI sequences), domain-specific feature representations, and the critical importance of preserving medical accuracy.

In this work, we present EfficientMedSAM2, a comprehensive knowledge distillation framework specifically designed for medical image segmentation. Our key contributions include:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item A novel three-stage knowledge distillation pipeline tailored for medical image segmentation, incorporating feature-level distillation, memory-aware distillation, and end-to-end fine-tuning
    \item Medical-specific architectural adaptations including 4-channel MRI handling and ROI-aware memory attention mechanisms
    \item Comprehensive evaluation demonstrating 100× parameter reduction (600M → 5.5M) while maintaining competitive segmentation performance
    \item A complete open-source framework enabling reproducible research and practical deployment in resource-constrained environments
\end{enumerate}

\section{Related Work}

\subsection{Medical Image Segmentation}

The field of medical image segmentation has evolved from traditional methods to deep learning approaches. U-Net \cite{ronneberger2015u} established the encoder-decoder architecture as the foundation for medical segmentation. Recent advances include nnU-Net \cite{isensee2021nnu}, which provides automated pipeline configuration, and transformer-based approaches like TransUNet \cite{chen2021transunet}.

The introduction of foundation models revolutionized medical segmentation. SAM \cite{kirillov2023segment} demonstrated remarkable zero-shot segmentation capabilities but showed limitations in medical domains. MedSAM \cite{ma2024medsam} addressed these limitations through medical-specific training, while MedSAM2 \cite{cheng2024medsam2} further improved performance with hierarchical vision transformers and memory attention mechanisms.

\subsection{Knowledge Distillation}

Knowledge distillation, introduced by Hinton et al. \cite{hinton2015distilling}, enables knowledge transfer from teacher to student networks through soft targets. Subsequent works explored various distillation strategies including attention transfer \cite{zagoruyko2016paying}, feature matching \cite{romero2014fitnets}, and progressive distillation \cite{phuong2019towards}.

Recent advances in knowledge distillation for computer vision include FitNets \cite{romero2014fitnets} for intermediate feature matching, and progressive knowledge distillation approaches that decompose the learning process into multiple stages. However, these methods primarily target natural image domains and have not been systematically adapted for medical imaging challenges.

\subsection{Model Compression for Medical AI}

Model compression for medical applications remains relatively underexplored. While general model compression techniques exist, knowledge distillation specifically for medical image segmentation, particularly for foundation models like MedSAM2, has not been comprehensively addressed, representing a significant gap in the literature.

\section{Methodology}

\subsection{Problem Formulation}

Given a teacher model $T$ (MedSAM2) with parameters $\theta_T$ and a student model $S$ (EfficientMedSAM2) with parameters $\theta_S$ where $|\theta_S| \ll |\theta_T|$, our objective is to minimize the distillation loss:

\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L}_{total} = \alpha \mathcal{L}_{seg} + \beta \mathcal{L}_{distill} + \gamma \mathcal{L}_{feature}
\end{equation}

where $\mathcal{L}_{seg}$ is the segmentation loss, $\mathcal{L}_{distill}$ is the knowledge distillation loss, and $\mathcal{L}_{feature}$ is the feature matching loss. The coefficients $\alpha$, $\beta$, and $\gamma$ balance the contribution of each component.

\subsection{Teacher Model: MedSAM2}

MedSAM2 serves as our teacher model, leveraging a hierarchical vision transformer (Hiera) backbone with multi-scale feature extraction. The architecture consists of:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Image Encoder}: Hiera backbone producing multi-scale features at 1/4 and 1/16 resolutions
    \item \textbf{Memory Attention}: Temporal consistency mechanism for video segmentation
    \item \textbf{Prompt Encoder}: Processes user prompts (points, boxes, masks)
    \item \textbf{Mask Decoder}: Generates high-quality segmentation masks
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Student Model: EfficientMedSAM2}

Our student architecture is designed for computational efficiency while preserving essential segmentation capabilities:

\subsubsection{Backbone Architecture}
We employ MobileNetV3-Small as the backbone, reducing parameters from 600M to 5.5M. The backbone incorporates:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Depthwise separable convolutions for efficiency
    \item Squeeze-and-excitation attention for feature refinement
    \item Hard-swish activation functions for mobile optimization
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Medical-Specific Adaptations}

\paragraph{4-Channel MRI Handling:} Medical images often contain multiple channels (e.g., FLAIR, T1w, T1gd, T2w for brain MRI). We implement a channel adaptation layer:

\begin{equation}
I_{3ch} = W_{adapt} \cdot I_{4ch} + b_{adapt}
\end{equation}

where $W_{adapt} \in \mathbb{R}^{3 \times 4}$ and $b_{adapt} \in \mathbb{R}^{3}$ are learnable parameters.

\paragraph{ROI-Aware Memory Attention:} We introduce a lightweight memory attention mechanism that focuses on regions of interest:

\begin{equation}
A_{roi} = \text{softmax}\left(\frac{Q_{roi} K_{roi}^T}{\sqrt{d_k}} \odot M_{roi}\right)
\end{equation}

where $M_{roi}$ is a learnable ROI mask that emphasizes anatomically relevant regions.

\subsection{Three-Stage Knowledge Distillation}

Our distillation framework comprises three progressive stages:

\subsubsection{Stage 1: Feature-Level Distillation}

We align intermediate features between teacher and student networks:

\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L}_{feature} = \sum_{i=1}^{N} \| f_i^T - \phi_i(f_i^S) \|_2^2
\end{equation}

where $f_i^T$ and $f_i^S$ are the $i$-th layer features of teacher and student, and $\phi_i$ are adaptation layers to match dimensionalities.

\subsubsection{Stage 2: Memory-Aware Distillation}

We transfer the teacher's memory attention patterns to the student:

\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L}_{memory} = \text{KL}(A^T \| A^S) + \text{MSE}(V^T, V^S)
\end{equation}

where $A^T$, $A^S$ are attention maps and $V^T$, $V^S$ are value representations.

\subsubsection{Stage 3: End-to-End Fine-tuning}

Final stage combines segmentation and distillation losses:

\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L}_{final} = \mathcal{L}_{dice} + \lambda \text{KL}(p^T \| p^S)
\end{equation}

where $p^T$ and $p^S$ are teacher and student prediction probabilities.
